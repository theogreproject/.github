# Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant v2.1 – short form)

We pledge to make participation in The Ogre Project a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
- Be respectful and constructive.  
- Assume good faith and focus on ideas, not people.  
- No harassment, hate speech, or discrimination.

## Enforcement
- Reports: contact maintainers at conduct@theogreproject.org (or open a private GitHub discussion).  
- Actions: warning → temporary restrictions → ban for severe/repeated violations.

## Attribution
